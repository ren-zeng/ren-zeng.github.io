Zeng Ren is a fourth-year PhD student in the Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab at EPFL. His thesis focuses on the phenomenon of repetition in music. His work integrates transparent reasoning (via deductive systems) and domain modeling (via type systems) with music theory. By formalizing musical structures as generative programs, his research is driven by two main questions: 1. What is the hypothesis space for such programs? 2. How can one infer such programs from their outputs, the musical surface?
