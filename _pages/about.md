Hi, I am Zeng Ren! I am a PhD candidate in the Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab at EPFL. My thesis focuses on the phenomenon of repetition in music and integrates transparent reasoning (deductive systems) and domain modeling (type systems) with music theory. By formalizing musical structures as generative programs, my research is driven by three main questions:

1. What is the hypothesis space for such programs?
2. How can one infer such programs from their outputs, the musical surface?
3. What are the common patterns in such learned programs and their musical interpretations?
